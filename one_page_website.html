			turtles are sub aquadic creatures that spend most of their time it the water. Most breeds of turtles can be found in freshwater bodies, such as rivers, ponds, and lakes. These creatures are solitary, oportunistic animals. They dont really hunt for food, they really just roam around and find whatever they can get. this includes small fish, shrimp, crayfish, insects, and tadpoles. Turtles are coldblooded animals that regulate their body tempurature by sunning themselves on large rocks that heat up in the day time. in the winter when its cold, turtles like to burrow underground and hybernate. To take care of a turtle, they need plenty of water to swim in, as well as a heat lamp and a uv lamp to get the right amount of nutrients for shell growth. another important thing for turtle is a balanced diet to get all their vitamins essential for growth.
